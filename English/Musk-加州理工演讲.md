All right;
I'd like to thank you for leaving 'crazy person' out of the description;

So, I thought - I was trying to think what's the most useful thing that I - what can say that can actually be helpful and useful to you in the future;

And I thought , perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here;

How did these things happen?

And maybe there are lessons there, I often find myself wondering, how did this happen;

when i was young, I didn't  really know what I was going to do when I got older;

People kept asking me, But then eventually I thought the idea of inventing things would be really cool;

And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Arthur C. Clark which said that "A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic ", And that's really true

If you go back say, 300years, the things we take for granted today, you'd be burned at stake for, Being able to fly, That's crazy;

Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with the Internet as a group mind of sorts;

And having access to all the world's information, instantly from almost anywhere on the earth;

This stuff that really would be magic - that would be considered magic in times past;

In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that, because there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined;

In times past, that weren't even in the realm of magic, So it actually goes beyond that;

So I thought, well if I can do some of those things basically if I can advance technology, then that is like magic and that would be really cool;

I always had an existential crisis, because I was trying  to figure out 'what does all mean?', likes 'what is the purpose of the things';

And I came to conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, If we can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened, And that's the only way forward.

So I studied physics and business, because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works;

And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something Because it's very difficult to do something as individuals if it's a significant technology

So, I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energu density of electric vechicles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries.

And that was in 1995, That's also the internet started to happen, And I thought well I coudl either pursue this technology, where success may not be one of the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, Or participate in the Internet and be part of it, So, I decided to drop out.

Fortunately, We're past graduation, So, I can't be accused of recommending that to you.

And I did some Internet stuff, You know, I've done a few things here and there.

One of which is PayPal, Maybe it's helpful to say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of PayPal was how it started. 

Because the initial thought with PayPal was to create a conglomeration of financial services, So if you have one place where all of your financial services needs could be seamlessly intergrated and works smoothly.

And we had a little feature, which was throught e-mail payments.

Whenever we'd show the system off to someone, we'd show the hard part, which was the conglomeration of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together.
Nobody was interested.

Then we showed people e-mail payments, which was quiet easy, and everybody was interested.

So, I think it's important to take feedback from your envirment. You want to be as closed-loop as possible.

So, we focused on e-mail payment and tried to make that work. And that's what really got things to take off.

But, if we hadn't responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been successful.

So, it's important  to look for things like that and focus on them when you seem them, and you correct your prior assumptions.

Going from Paypal, I thought well what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?

It really wasn't from the perspective of, 'what's the best way to make money,which is okay, But it was really' what do I think is going to most affect the future of humanity.'

So, the biggest terrestrial problem wa've got is sustainable energy.

But the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner.

If we dont solve that in this century, we're in deep trouble.

And the other one being the extension of Life beyond earth to make life multi-planetary.

So, that's the basis for -- the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the format is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity. 

When I started SpaceX, initially, I thought that well, there's no way one could start a rocket company.

I wasn't that crazy.

But then, I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA's budget?

That was actually my initial goal.

I thought well if we could do a low-cost mission to Mars,  something called Mars Oasis, which would land with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel(脱水营养凝胶), then hydrate them upon landing.

And you'd have this great short of money shot of green plants on a red background.

The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives.

And this would be the first life on Mars and the furthest life had ever traveled as fa as we know.

And I thought well that would get people really excited and increase NASA's budget.
